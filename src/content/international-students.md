# For International Students

With some of the world's best programs in computer science and robotics, the Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science attracts students from many nations. More than 40 percent of our students are natives of countries other than the United States. We pride ourself on creating—together with our students—[a welcoming and supportive environment](http://www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/oie/forstu/index.html) for their different cultures, languages and traditions. Carnegie Mellon University and SCS offer [a variety of resources](http://www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/oie/forscho/index.html) to help students interested in earning a degree at our Pittsburgh campus.

## Undergraduate Students

All undergraduate applications are handled by the [Carnegie Mellon Office of Undergraduate Admission](http://admission.enrollment.cmu.edu/pages/international-admission-requirements). Students from outside the United States are not eligible for Carnegie Mellon University financial aid. Deadlines for international students are the same as those posted for U.S. students. However, international students should submit a pre-application as soon as possible. Students whose native language is not English must complete either the Test of English as a Foreign Language or the International English Language Testing System exam. Scores must be sent no later than Jan. 1. For more information about undergraduate studies at SCS, please see the [Undergraduate Programs](/undergraduate-programs) and [Undergraduate Admissions](/undergraduate-admissions) pages.

## Graduate Students

Admission to master's and doctoral degree programs are handled by the seven degree-granting departments in the School of Computer Science. International students should contact these departments directly to learn about admission requirements and deadlines. Please see the [Masters Programs](/masters-programs), [Masters Admissions](/masters-admissions), [Doctoral Programs](doctoral-programs), and [Doctoral Admissions](/doctoral-admissions) pages for more information specific to your program of interest.
