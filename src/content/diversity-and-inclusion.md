# Diversity and Inclusion

### SCS4ALL

[SCS4ALL](https://www.scs4all.cs.cmu.edu/) is a student-run initiative that works to develop a program of social and professional activities and leadership opportunities for the SCS community along with outreach events to broaden interest and participation in computing.

### Women@SCS

The [Women@SCS](https://www.women.cs.cmu.edu/) mission is to create, encourage, and promote women's academic, social and professional opportunities in the computer sciences and to promote the breadth of the field and its diverse community. The Women@SCS Advisory Committee consists of undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty within the School of Computer Science.

### BiasBusters@CMU

[BiasBusters@CMU](https://scs4all.cs.cmu.edu/biasbusters/) is modeled on Googleâ€™s Bias Busting@ Work program, and developed in concert with Google. The program was piloted in the School of Computer Science (BiasBusters@SCS,CMU) to engage over issues of bias, diversity, and inclusion. BiasBusters sessions are led by members of the CMU community who have volunteered to be trained as program facilitators. BiasBusters@CMU now reaches communities across the Carnegie Mellon campus.

Several things distinguish BiasBusters@CMU from similar programs. First is the framing: the program has an academic tone, focusing on summaries of research evidence into which discussions of experience are woven. Second, the role-playing, based on relevant and real life scenarios, has proved to be a powerful and effective approach for engaging participants, both at Google and at CMU, creating commitments to greater inclusion.
