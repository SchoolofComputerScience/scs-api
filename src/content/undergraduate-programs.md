# Undergraduate Programs

## Undergraduate Majors

The School of Computer Science offers bachelor's degrees in both [computer science](http://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/education/bscs/index.html) and, beginning in fall 2017, [computational biology](http://www.cbd.cmu.edu/education/bs-in-computational-biology/). Interdisciplinary majors in [computer science and the arts](http://www.cmu.edu/interdisciplinary/programs/bcsaprogram.html), and [music and technology](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~music/mat/bachelor.html) are also available.

## Undergraduate Additional Majors

SCS offers additional majors in [computer science](http://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/education/bscs/second.html#major), [human-computer interaction](http://www.hcii.cmu.edu/applying-undergraduate-major), and [robotics](http://major.ri.cmu.edu/). Students wishing to earn a second, or "double," major must obtain their primary bachelor of science degree from another department (typically the Computer Science Department or Electrical and Computer Engineering).

Admissions to all bachelor of science programs are administered through the [Carnegie Mellon Office of Undergraduate Admissions](http://admission.enrollment.cmu.edu/).

## Undergraduate Minors

The School of Computer Science offers eight undergraduate minors. Accepted and enrolled undergraduate students interested in a minor should contact their academic advisor for more information.

## IDEATE: Technology, Design and Arts Study

Carnegie Mellonâ€™s diverse and top-ranked departments in computing, engineering, design, and arts are uniquely positioned to serve students who have interdisciplinary interests bridging technology and creative practice. The IDEATE concentrations and minors connect students and faculty from across the university through coursework and collaborative studio experiences. As a computer science student at Carnegie Mellon, you will have the opportunity to integrate in your degree a concentration or minor in one of eight creative industry areas: Game Design, Animation & Special Effects, Media Design, Learning Media, Sound Design, Entrepreneurship for Creative Industries, Intelligent Environments, or Physical Computing.
