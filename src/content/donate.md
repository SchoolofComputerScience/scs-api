To help fund the dean's strategic research initiatives, you can donate to the Dean’s Innovation Fund — a general fund used at the dean’s discretion to support the early stages of the truly life-changing research we work on every day and that will have far-reaching implications for society.

The Mark Stehlik SCS Alumni Undergraduate Impact Scholarship recognizes and supports SCS undergraduates whose reach for excellence extends beyond the classroom — who are working to make a difference both in the field of computer science and the world around them. The award, created by the SCS Alumni Advisory Board, encourages SCS undergraduates to increase their engagement in research and community service, and to reach beyond their courses and grades. It shows the best and brightest SCS students that the community supports their tireless efforts to excel in all they do. And it’s appropriately named for former Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Education Mark Stehlik, who has been a tireless force for encouraging a generation of students to shine in computer science, extracurricular activities and life.

### Outreach Fund

The world needs more computer scientists, and we’re doing our part to meet the demand. We’re working hard to make sure every child in America has the opportunity to study computer science, regardless of their school district. We hope some will come to CMU, but we’re more worried about opening doors for them no matter where they go to college. Gifts to the Outreach Fund empower our efforts to inspire and support kids everywhere.
