# SCS Outreach Programs

Careers in the so-called “STEM” fields—science, technology, engineering and math—are a major driving force of the 21st century economy. That's why the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University is part of a multi-faceted effort to attract more students to study STEM fields such as computing, information technology and robotics, and to retain those students. Our outreach programs have been developed over more than a decade. They reach across disciplines and into communities across the United States, starting with educational programs for teachers and students in primary school right up into high school. We pay particular attention to encouraging more participation by women and under-represented minorities—not by watering down the lessons, but by giving students the fundamental tools they need to succeed.

#### Botball

The Botball Educational Robotics Program engages secondary school students in a team-oriented robotics competition. By designing, building, programming and documenting robots, students use science, engineering, technology, math and writing skills in a hands-on project that reinforces learning. By exposing students to an inquiry-based, learn-by-doing activity that appeals to their hearts as well as their minds, Botball addresses the need for well-prepared, creative, yet effective students with leadership and teamwork experience.

Botball starts with a workshop where representatives from each team learn about current robotics technology. Teachers and students are trained to design, build and program their robots from scratch. Following the workshop, students are given 8 weeks to create a robot or a team of autonomous robots to achieve a specific task. Student teams pit their robots head-to-head in a fast paced, non-destructive competition.

[http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~listen/](http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~listen/)

Project LISTEN (Literacy Innovation that Speech Technology Enables) is an inter-disciplinary research project at Carnegie Mellon University to develop a novel tool to improve literacy; an automated Reading Tutor that displays stories on a computer screen, and listens to children read aloud. To provide a pleasant, authentic experience in assisted reading, the Reading Tutor lets the child choose from a menu of high-interest stories from Weekly Reader and other sources including user-authored stories. The Reading Tutor adapts Carnegie Mellon's Sphinx-II speech recognizer to analyze the student's oral reading and intervenes when the reader makes mistakes, gets stuck, clicks for help, or is likely to encounter difficulty. The Reading Tutor responds with assistance modeled in part after expert reading teachers, but adapted to the capabilities and limitations of the technology. The current version runs under Windows (TM) 2000 on an ordinary Pentium (TM) with at least 128MB of memory. In 2002-2003, hundreds of students are using the Reading Tutor at 9 schools.
